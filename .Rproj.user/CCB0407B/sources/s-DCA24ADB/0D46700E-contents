# Introduction {#intro}

In this study, we apply a spatial microsimulation technique (SMS) to estimate holiday behaviour at the individual level in Leeds. SMS is a technique that helps spatial analysts estimate the characteristics of a population by combining traditional census data (in this case the 2011 census) with smaller, more specific surveys. We use MSM in our study as it provides, Lovelace and Dumont argue, the best of both worlds by combining “the advantages of individual level data with geographical specificity…”.  (2016, Lovelace & Dumont, p.32). It works by estimating what individuals are like in an area, based on aggregate statistics. It is, in its simplest form, a technique for the generation of a set of individuals, the characteristics for which match aggregate statistics for an area. The creation of this synthetic data means SMS can work as an adequate substitute for when real world data is not available. 
This project in turn uses SMS as a technique as a means to estimate a population level dataset of holiday making behaviours of Leeds households. 

This project focuses on destinations of the city-holiday type, with an aim at profiling consumers holydaying in those destinations so as to later target those same consumers. 
Chapter 2 of this project explores the methods and data used, chapter 3 focuses on the profiling of the costumers, and chapter 4 discusses the results and possible ways forward.
