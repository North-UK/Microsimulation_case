It does so by profiling individuals that go on holiday to the USA, based on 5 different characteristics. It finalizes by recommending a targeted marketing campaign based on the findings. "],["intro.html", "Chapter 2 Introduction", " Chapter 2 Introduction In this study, we apply a spatial microsimulation technique (SMS) to estimate holiday behaviour at the individual level in Leeds. SMS is a technique that helps spatial analysts estimate the characteristics of a population by combining traditional census data (in this case the 2011 census) with smaller, more specific surveys. We use MSM in our study as it provides, Lovelace and Dumont argue, the best of both worlds by combining the advantages of individual level data with geographical specificity. (2016, Lovelace &amp; Dumont, p.32). It works by estimating what individuals are like in an area, based on aggregate statistics. It is, in its simplest form, a technique for the generation of a set of individuals, the characteristics for which match aggregate statistics for an area. The creation of this synthetic data means SMS can work as an adequate substitute for when real world data is not available. This project in turn uses SMS as a technique as a means to estimate a population level dataset of holiday making behaviours of Leeds households. This project focuses on destinations of the city-holiday type, with an aim at profiling consumers holydaying in those destinations so as to later target those same consumers. Chapter 2 of this project explores the methods and data used, chapter 3 focuses on the profiling of the costumers, and chapter 4 discusses the results and possible ways forward. "],["data-and-methods.html", "Chapter 3 Data and Methods", " Chapter 3 Data and Methods After having created the microsimulated data, we are left with 19 variables, one of which (Holiday_type) was determined while the data was simulated. A breakdown of the variables can be observed in the table below: Variable Detail Person_id ID of respondent. Zone Leeds Output Area Classification. Oac_grp OA Supergroup. Sex Respondents sex Age_band Repondents age band. Number_children Number of children per respondent Household_income Respondents household income Overseas_airport The name of the overseas airport. UK_airport Name of the airport in the UK. Satisafaction_overall Level of satisfaction with most recent holiday. Age_sex Sex and Age. Supergroup_name Respondents supergroup. Dest_airport_name The name of the destination airport. Dest_airport_city The name of the city the destination airport is in. Dest_airport_country The name of the country the destination airport is in. Orig_airport_name The name of the origin airport. Orig_airport_city The name of the city the origin airport is in. Holiday_type The name of the city the origin airport is in in.

There appears to be a higher concentration of oversampling near the city region, evident by the darker shades in the figure. Figure 3.1: Simulation Oversampling The microsimulated data allows us to, as previously mentioned, to have an idea of the top destinations by location. The dotplot of frequencies by holiday type can be seen below: Figure 3.2: Top Destinations by Holiday Type As we can see, top beach destinations are Spain, Greece and Egypt. For cities, Turkey, Tunisia and the USA come on top. In turn, we profile the holidaymakers going to these locations of Orlando (MCO), Florida (SFB) and Las Vegas (LAS). "],["results.html", "Chapter 4 Results", " Chapter 4 Results With the city of list destinations we can go on to compare how the population holidaying to those destinations differ from the general Leeds population. By focusing on 5 demographic variables, namely age band, number of children, overall satisfaction, supergroup name and household income, we can see how holiday makers compare to the general population. Figure 4.1: Difference in Proportion of Characteristics off Holidaymakers to Orlando and Las Vegas We can see how these holiday makers tend to be more mature, 35 to 49, with children, usually 2. These holiday makers also have a houselhold income of 41-50k, and appear to on the end part of the scale in terms of satisfaction with their holidays. They also belong to the Suburbanites/Urbanites, indicating a possible richer and comfortable segment of society. To expand on this knowledge, we can map the geographical distribution of holidaymakers. Unsurprisingly, they are located around the edge of towns, reflecting their supergroup codes. Figure 4.2: Geographical Distribution of Target Market "],["conclusion.html", "Chapter 5 Conclusion", " Chapter 5 Conclusion This study attempted to investigate the profile of those holiday makers to city destinations in the USA. As a normal problem faced by microsimulation, oversampling occurred in some parts of the city center and its surroundings. In the data and methods section, the different destinations according to holiday type were demonstrated. In the results section, together with the five variables, age band, household income, number of children, and satisfaction with most recent holiday and Supergroup name, we developed a unique consumer profile. In conclusion, it is suggested that the targeted market be developed around the young professionals aged between 35 to 49 who have children, and a relatively high income of 41-50k.
